             Lição 01 - Japonês Facilitado<br>

            <h3>Introdução</h3>
            <p>Hello, everyone.</p>
                <p>My name is Cure Dolly and I am here to teach you Organic Japanese.</p>
            <p>What is Organic Japanese? It is Japanese pure and simple, with no harmful additives.</p>
        <p>Japanese is the simplest, the most logical, the most easily understandable language I have ever encountered – much easier than Western languages.</p>
    <p>But you wouldn't know that if you try to learn it from Western textbooks or Japanese learning websites.</p>
                
<p>Why not? Because they don't teach Japanese structure.They teach English structure and then try to force Japanese into it.</p>
            <p>And it doesn't fit, and it doesn't work very well.</p>
            <p>That is the main reason, I think, why so many people give up Japanese.</p>
            <p>The Western system makes it seem complicated, full of strange exceptions and odd rules that you have to memorize.</p>
            <p>And none of this is true if you learn the language the way it really is.</p>
                
            <p>So, this course is not just for people beginning Japanese.</p>
            <p>It's very good for those people – this is the best way to start.</p>
            <p>But if you've been learning Japanese for a while and you find yourself getting confused by things, it would be very good to watch this series and learn from the start the way Japanese should have been explained in the first place.</p>
            <p>All right, let's get started.</p>
